# machine-learning
This project applies various machine learning models to three distinct datasets, each addressing different domains: e-commerce customer behaviors, health-related factors for diabetes, and banking customer subscription patterns. The goal is to leverage the CRISP-DM methodology for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation using models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Q-Learning, and Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Performance evaluation focuses on metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and ROC scores, highlighting the impact of dataset characteristics and preparation on model effectiveness.


Summary:

Datasets: E-commerce browsing behavior, health data on diabetes, and banking customer subscription.

Models Used: SVM, Decision Tree, MLP, Q-Learning, and ILP.

Methodology: CRISP-DM for preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

Metrics: Accuracy, F1 score, ROC scores.

Findings: Performance varies across models, driven by dataset characteristics and data preparation methods.
